#Garment Employee Productivity Precidition

Garment Employee Productivity Prediction

Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee productivity in a garment manufacturing setting using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features related to the production environment and employee performance, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast productivity levels. This predictive model can be valuable for optimizing workforce management and improving overall efficiency in garment production.

Features
Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing information about the garment production process, including factors such as the working hours,incentive,day_of_week,trageted productivity,etc

Machine Learning Models: Different machine learning algorithms, such as regression models, are employed to predict employee productivity based on historical data.

Feature Engineering: The project involves preprocessing and engineering relevant features to enhance the model's accuracy and effectiveness. Feature scaling, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables are some of the preprocessing steps applied.

Evaluation Metrics: The performance of the productivity prediction model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running provided notebooks)
